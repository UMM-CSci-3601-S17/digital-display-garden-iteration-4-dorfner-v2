# WCROC Horticulture Display Garden Mobile Application and Administration Management

## User interface
This application was created to allow the visitors to engage with the garden, and leave feedback. Visitors can navigate the plants virtually and leave comments on the ones that are the most interesting to them. The application also allows for the user to like or dislike the flowers. 

**There are two simple ways that a visitor can get to the _application_:**

1. Enter homepage URL

**or**
2. Scan a bed's QR code (located next to each bed)

<br>
<br>
<br>

**Then there are two ways that a visitor can get to a specific _flower_, from the homepage:**
1. Search by common name on the search bar in the homepage
<br>
<br>
   > There is a 'Find a flower' search bar that lets the user search for plants by their _Common name_ which are then displayed in order of beds.

**or**
2. Use bed's dropdown menu to go from a bed to a list of flowers
<br>
<br>
<br>


Once the visitor is in a specific flower page, they can then rate the flower by liking or disliking it, and/or leaving a comment. 
<br>
<br>
The app is meant to help Steve and Esther gather information on preferences and suggestions about the garden. At the bottom of all the pages in the application, there are links to social media and to the WCROC official website.
