# WCROC Horticulture Display Garden Mobile Application and Administration Management

## User interface
This application was created to allow visitors to engage with the garden, and leave feedback. The feedback can 
be used to help the Horticulturalists know which plants are popular and improve visitor experience.

**There are two simple ways that a visitor can use to get to the application:**

* Type a URL into a browser
* Scan a QR code

You can enter the application at either a bed or the homepage. 

**From the homepage, there are two ways that a visitor can get to a flower:**
* Use search bar to filter by a certain Common Name 
* Use bed's dropdown menu to go to a bed that contains the flower

Once the visitor is at a flower, they can rate the flower by liking or disliking it, and/or leaving a comment. 

## Administration side

The administration side has features that are only accessible by authorized WCROC staff.
These features provide a simple way for administrators to interact with the system and include:
 
* Importing a spreadsheet with appropriate data (.xlsx)
    * Re-populating data with new spreadsheet annually 
* Exporting data to an Excel file with four tabs:
    * Comments
    * Counts (number of likes, dislikes, visits, and comments for each plant)
    * Hourly timestamps (shows what time visitors are in garden)
    * Daily timestamps (shows number of visits for each day of the year)
* Generating and downloading QR codes for each bed
* Uploading an image for individual plants by plant ID 
* Deleting previous data
